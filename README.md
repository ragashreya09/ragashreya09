## Hi, I’m Raga Shreya 👋

I build machine learning systems that go beyond notebooks and work in production.
With 3+ years of experience, I focus on taking ideas from data exploration to
trained models, deployed APIs, and monitored ML systems.

My background spans classical machine learning, MLOps, and Generative AI, and I
enjoy designing end-to-end pipelines where models are trained, evaluated, served,
and improved over time.

### 🔧 What I Work With
- Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, MLflow
- LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), FastAPI
- AWS, GCP, Docker, Terraform

### 📂 Featured Projects
- **Customer Churn Prediction System**  
  End-to-end ML pipeline covering data processing, model training, evaluation,
  and FastAPI-based deployment for real-time inference.

- **AI Career Copilot**  
  Deployed AI application for resume analysis, skill-gap identification, and
  career recommendations using LLM-powered workflows.

- **Virtual Assistant for Visually Impaired**  
  Voice-enabled system combining NLP, OCR, and speech recognition to enable
  document reading and hands-free interaction.

### 🌍 Open to Opportunities
Open to roles where I can **build, deploy, and scale** machine learning systems,
and collaborate on solving real-world problems.
