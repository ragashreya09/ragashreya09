## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with **5+ years of experience** designing systems that go well past the notebook stage — through training, evaluation, deployment, and real-world monitoring.

My work lives at the intersection of **classical ML**, **MLOps**, and **Generative AI**. I care about the full picture: clean data pipelines, reliable APIs, models that don't quietly drift, and AI systems that actually solve problems for real users.

```python
raga = {
    "experience"  : "5+ years in ML, MLOps & Generative AI",
    "focus"       : ["Production ML Systems", "LLM-Powered Agents", "End-to-End Pipelines"],
    "philosophy"  : "A model that isn't deployed is just an experiment.",
    "currently"   : "Building AI agents that make data analysis conversational",
    "open_to"     : "Roles where I can build, deploy, and scale ML systems"
}
```

## 📂 Featured Projects

---

### 📊 AI Data Analysis Agent
> *Talk to your data. Get instant answers. No SQL needed.*

A conversational AI agent that lets anyone analyze CSV and Excel files through plain English — no SQL expertise required. GPT-4o translates natural language into precise SQL queries, DuckDB executes them at speed, and results surface instantly through a clean Streamlit interface. Orchestrated with the Agno Agent Framework for reliable, structured agent behavior.

**Stack:** `Agno Framework` `GPT-4o` `DuckDB` `Streamlit` `Python`

---

### 📉 Customer Churn Prediction System
> *From raw data to real-time inference — fully end to end.*

A production-grade ML pipeline covering data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation — served as a FastAPI microservice for real-time churn predictions. Experiment tracking via MLflow ensures every run is reproducible and comparable.

**Stack:** `scikit-learn` `FastAPI` `MLflow` `Docker` `Python`

---

### 🧭 AI Career Copilot
> *Your AI-powered career advisor.*

A deployed LLM application that parses resumes, identifies skill gaps, and delivers personalized career recommendations using RAG-powered workflows. Built for real users with a production-grade backend and context-aware response generation.

**Stack:** `GPT-4o` `RAG` `LangChain` `FastAPI` `Python`

---

### 🦯 Virtual Assistant for the Visually Impaired
> *Giving documents a voice.*

A voice-enabled accessibility system combining NLP, OCR, and speech recognition — allowing visually impaired users to read documents and navigate interfaces entirely hands-free. Designed with accessibility as the core, not an afterthought.

**Stack:** `NLP` `OCR` `Speech Recognition` `Python`

---

## 🌍 Open to Opportunities

I'm looking for roles where I can **build, deploy, and scale** machine learning and AI systems — working with teams who care about taking ideas all the way from research to production impact.
